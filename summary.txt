Introduction
“Not just a library”

This means React Testing Library (RTL) is not only a set of functions like render, screen, fireEvent, etc.

It also comes with strong ideas about how you should write tests.

So it doesn’t just give you tools — it tells you how to think about testing.

“But a philosophy”

The philosophy of React Testing Library is:

Test your app the way users use it, not the way it’s implemented.

In practice, that means:

✅ Test what the user sees and does

❌ Don’t test internal details (state, props, component methods)

Example:

✅ “Can the user see this text?”

✅ “Can the user click this button and get a result?”

❌ “Is this state variable set to true?”

❌ “Was this internal function called?”

“(Opinionated)”

Opinionated means:

The library intentionally pushes you toward certain patterns and away from others.

RTL discourages:

getByClassName

Accessing component instances

Testing implementation details

RTL encourages:

getByRole

getByLabelText

getByText

Why?
Because real users don’t care about class names or state — they care about buttons, labels, and text.

Simple real-life analogy 🧠

Think of RTL like a driving instructor:

❌ Not: “Turn the engine shaft by 30 degrees”

✅ But: “Press the accelerator and steer”

You don’t care how the car works internally — you care that it drives correctly.

One-sentence summary (important 💡)

When they say:

“Not just a library but a philosophy (opinionated)”

They mean:

React Testing Library doesn’t just give you testing tools — it enforces a mindset: write tests that reflect real user behavior, even if that limits how you test.
